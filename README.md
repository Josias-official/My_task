### cafe.py
Hello there! Welcome to our inventory management project. Here, we're building a system to keep track of things. 
To start, we make a shopping list called "menu" to know what we have. 
Then, we create two special lists named "stock" and "price." "Stock" will hold how much we have of each thing,
and "price" will store their costs. The exciting part is calculating how much all our stuff is worth combined. 
We'll do that by multiplying the amount of each item in stock with its price.
Finally, we'll show you the total value of everything in our inventory. 

### holiday.py
Create a Python file called holiday.py.
calculate a user’s holiday cost including the plane cost, hotel cost, and
car rental cost.
● First, get the following user inputs:
○ city_flight: The city they will be flying to. (You can create some
options for them. Remember: Each city will have different flight
costs.)
○ num_nights: The number of nights they will be staying at a hotel
○ rental_days: The number of days that they will be hiring a car for.
● Next, create the following four functions:
● hotel_cost: This function will take the num_nights as an argument,
and return a total cost for the hotel stay (You can choose the price
per night charged at the hotel).
● plane_cost: This function will take the city_flight as an argument
and return a cost for the flight (hint: use if/else if statements in the
function to retrieve a price based on the chosen city).
● car_rental: This function will take the rental_days as an argument
and return the total cost of the car rental (you can choose the daily
rental cost.)
● holiday_cost: This function will take the three arguments
hotel_cost, plane_cost, car_rental. Using these three
arguments, you can call all three of the above functions with
respective arguments and finally return a total cost for your
holiday.
● Print out all the details about the holiday in a readable way!
● Try using your program with different combinations of input to show its
compatibility with different options.

### task3
Hey there! Welcome to our triathlon management program. 
This project is all about making things smooth for participants.
First off, we'll create parts to read swimming times, then cycling times, and after that, running times.
The exciting part is when we award participants based on how well they did overall.
This happens by adding up all their times. 
Finally, we'll show you the total time it took for each participant to finish the entire triathlon.
